# Real Estate Price Prediction and Recommendation System

## Project Overview

This project leverages data science techniques to provide insights, predictions, and personalized recommendations for real estate properties. The goal is to predict real estate prices accurately and provide personalized property recommendations based on user preferences such as location, facilities, and price. The project utilizes **machine learning models** for price estimation and a **recommendation engine** to enhance user experience. It integrates various steps including data scraping, cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis, model development, and deployment via a web-based interface using **Streamlit**.

## Key Features

- **Data Collection & Cleaning**: Scraped property data from 99acres using Python, BeautifulSoup. Cleaned and merged data using Pandas and NumPy, handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
  
- **Feature Engineering**: Created new features such as luxury scores, furniture details, and area type specifications to improve property price predictions and recommendations.
  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducted EDA using Pandas Profiling, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to uncover key patterns in property data. Automated EDA reports provided insights into data distribution, missing values, and feature interactions.
  
- **Model Development**: Built and compared several machine learning models including Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, LASSO, Ridge, ElasticNet, and more, to predict property prices.
  
- **Recommendation System**: Designed a personalized recommendation system using cosine similarity and Scikit-learn to recommend properties based on user preferences such as facilities, price, and location.
  
- **Deployment**: Deployed the model and recommendation system using **Streamlit**, providing a user-friendly interface for real-time price predictions and personalized recommendations.
  
- **Custom Analytics Module**: Built an analytics module using Seaborn, Plotly, and Folium to visualize real estate data through geographical maps, scatter plots, pie charts, and word clouds, offering comprehensive insights into the real estate market.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Conducted **EDA** using **Pandas Profiling**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn** to uncover trends and patterns in property data.
- Automated **EDA** reports generated for comprehensive insights into variable distributions, missing data, and correlations.

## Model Development

- Implemented and compared multiple machine learning models using **Scikit-learn** and **XGBoost**, including:
  - Linear Regression
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting
  - LASSO, Ridge, and ElasticNet
- Evaluated model performance using metrics like **RÂ²**, **MAE**, and **RMSE**.

## Recommendation System

- A **recommendation engine** built using **cosine similarity** and **Scikit-learn** to suggest properties based on user preferences (facilities, location, price).
- Integrated into the **Streamlit** interface for ease of use and accessibility.

## Data Visualization

- Created an analytics module with **Seaborn**, **Plotly**, to visualize geographical data, property trends, and word clouds.
